# Java Robots Simulation

This Java project simulates a set of robot types using object-oriented programming principles like inheritance, method overriding, and encapsulation.

## Classes

- `Robot.java`: Base robot with movement and direction control (left turns).
- `SpecialRobot.java`: Adds the ability to turn right.
- `MoreSpecialRobot.java`: Adds a battery system that limits movement.
- `Main.java`: Demonstrates robot creation and movement.

## Features

- Position tracking `(x, y)`
- Direction handling (NORTH, EAST, SOUTH, WEST)
- Battery constraints (only in advanced robot)
